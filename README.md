# Course Completion Certificate Smart Contract

## Vision

The **Course Completion Certificate Smart Contract** is designed to streamline the issuance and verification of course completion certificates on the Ethereum blockchain. This decentralized approach ensures that certificates are immutable, verifiable, and easily accessible to all stakeholders. Our goal is to create a transparent, tamper-proof system where users can prove their achievements and institutions can confidently issue certifications without intermediary intervention.

## Features

### 1. **User Registration**
   - Users can register themselves for the course.
   - The system ensures that each user can only register once.

### 2. **Video Completion**
   - Users can mark videos as completed as they progress through the course.
   - The system tracks the user's progress across multiple levels.

### 3. **Quiz Completion**
   - Users must complete videos before they can pass quizzes.
   - Certification is granted automatically upon completing all levels if the quiz is passed.

### 4. **Certificate Issuance**
   - Once a user completes all course levels and passes the final quiz, a certificate is issued.
   - The certificate is recorded on the blockchain and can be verified by others.

### 5. **Certificate Verification**
   - Anyone can verify whether a user has received a certificate by querying the smart contract.
   - The verification process is transparent and secure.

### 6. **Dynamic Levels Adjustment**
   - The course owner can adjust the number of levels in the course dynamically.

### 7. **Ownership and Security**
   - Only the owner of the smart contract can adjust the total number of levels in the course.

## Future Scope

1. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Integration with frontend applications to provide users with an intuitive interface for registration, progress tracking, and certificate viewing.

2. **Additional Features**
   - Implementing reward systems or badges for additional milestones.
   - Support for multiple courses and certifications.

3. **Blockchain Integration**
   - Integration with other blockchain platforms for cross-chain certificate verification.
   - Exploring Layer 2 solutions to reduce transaction costs and improve performance.

4. **Audit and Compliance**
   - Implementing auditing features to track changes and ensure compliance with educational standards.

5. **Interoperability**
   - Allowing integration with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) and other educational tools.
